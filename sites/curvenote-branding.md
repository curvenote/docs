Our pricing model is intended to enable researchers, lab groups and communities to easily take charge of their Open Access publishing, with minimal friction, while having the means to produce high quality web based articles to rival journal publications. Minimal Curvenote branding / logo will be retained in the Curvenote tag, in the top right, and Curvenote footer.

## Curvenote tag

:label: fig:curvenote-tag
The Curvenote tag (top right) is included on all sites. Example from [Applied Geophysics](https://www.appliedgeophysics.org/).

## Curvenote footer

We provide a number of different footers for our sites, for example, to link to our terms of service and privacy agreements for the hosting. This footer can be customized based on your journal or site.

:::

As the Curvenote footer is a required element, this is configured when you setup your deployment for the first time with Curvenote. The Curvenote footer is the last element shown on the page, and appears below any custom footers that you have included for your site [](./navigation.md)

## White labeling and enterprise

If you would like the Curvenote logo and footer to _not_ appear on your site, ask us about white-labeling and custom themes.
