**Objective:**  
Choose and personalize your site’s layout and theme to match your brand and ensure your content is visually appealing and easy to read.
:::

## Before You Start
Make sure you have:
- A Curvenote account with access to your site’s settings in the web admin interface
- Primary and secondary brand colors (hex values)
- Logo and dark mode logo (SVG or PNG)
- Any preferred fonts or typography guidelines

## Steps to Choose a Layout & Theme

### 1. Open Site Settings
- Navigate to your site in the Curvenote web admin interface.
- Go to **Design** or **Theme Settings**.

### 2. Select a Layout
Curvenote supports several content layouts for landing and listing pages:
- **Grid – Centered**
- **Grid – Left**
- **Normal** (standard content width)

Choose the layout that best fits your audience and content type. You can change this later.

### 3. Apply Brand Colors
- Enter your **primary** and **secondary** color values.
- Preview changes to ensure text and buttons remain accessible and readable.

### 4. Upload Logos
- **Brand Logo**: Appears in the site header.
- **Dark Mode Logo**: Used when visitors switch to dark mode.
- Recommended: a simple, square format without text for flexibility.

### 5. Set Fonts
- **Title/Brand Font**: Typically a bold or distinctive font for headings.
- **Main Text Font**: Easy-to-read sans-serif or serif.
- **Technical/Monospace Font**: Used for code snippets or inline commands.

### 6. Save and Preview
- Save your changes.
- View the site in both light and dark modes to confirm visual consistency.

:::{note} Example
A research journal might use a clean **Grid – Centered** layout with a dark blue primary color (#003366), white secondary color (#FFFFFF), and a sans-serif body font.
