# Choose a Layout & Theme

## Overview
Customize your site's visual appearance by selecting layouts, colors, fonts, and branding elements to match your organization's identity

Your site's layout and theme determine how your content is presented to visitors. Curvenote provides flexible options to create a professional, branded appearance that enhances readability and user experience.

- Your site already created and accessible

## 2. Choose Your Layout

Select how your content will be displayed:
