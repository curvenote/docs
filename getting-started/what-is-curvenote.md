# What is Curvenote?

Curvenote is a platform for **writing, organizing, and publishing scientific content**—built by researchers, for researchers.

It helps you move beyond static PDFs by enabling **interactive, modular, and versioned scientific outputs**. Whether you're drafting a preprint, creating a lab website, or sharing reproducible analyses, Curvenote provides the tools to publish with **structure, transparency, and flexibility**.

## A new kind of scientific output

Most research outputs today are frozen in time—locked into PDFs and detached from their underlying data, code, and figures. Curvenote takes a different approach:

- **Modular articles** with reusable blocks and components  
- **Versioned content** that tracks every change  
- **Web-first publishing** for better discoverability  
- **One-click exports** to Typst or PDF when needed  


Work in your browser or use the Curvenote CLI:  

- Write in **Markdown, Jupyter**, or the Curvenote editor  
- Organize content into **folders, articles, and blocks**  
- Connect to **GitHub** for version control and collaboration  
- Publish to the web with a single command  
- Export to Typst or PDF for review or submission

## Publishing as part of your workflow  
Publishing with Curvenote is fast and flexible. You can publish:  

- Single articles  
- Multi-article collections (lab sites, conference proceedings, documentation)  
- Research outputs with **interactive figures, notebooks, and citations**  

Everything you publish stays editable and updateable—no reformatting required.  


## Built for research teams  
Curvenote supports:  

- Collaborative editing & version tracking  
- Reusable figures, text blocks, and citations  
- DOI minting & metadata management  
- Research integrity checks (iThenticate, Proofig)  
- Compliance with open science, funder, and institutional policies  


## Why it matters  
Scientific knowledge should be **open, versioned, and reusable**. Curvenote provides the infrastructure for **living research outputs**—helping you move faster, stay organized, and share work in ways that are valuable to both humans and machines.
