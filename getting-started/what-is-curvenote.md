## Welcome
Learn about Curvenote and how to get started

Curvenote is a platform for **writing, organizing, and publishing scientific content**—built by researchers, for researchers. Add your text, datasets, and figures to create interactive, modular, and versioned scientific outputs that move beyond static PDFs.

## What makes Curvenote different?

- Organize content into **folders, articles, and blocks**  
- Connect to **GitHub** for version control and collaboration  
- Publish to the web with a single command  
- Export to Typst or PDF for review or submission
