**Objective:**  
Request a Curvenote site so you can publish and share your work online.

## Before You Start
- Curvenote account + CLI installed.
- Only Curvenote staff can create sites — you’ll use our onboarding form.

## Request a Site
- Fill out the [Site Setup Request Form](https://forms.gle/Y8ppqCpPFKPH5GFr7)
- Curvenote will set up:
  - **Title & subdomain** (e.g., `my-lab.curve.space`)
  - **Public or private** visibility
  - **Initial landing content**
- You’ll receive a confirmation email once your site is live.

## Next Steps After Creation
- Review your site’s landing page.
- Follow the [Manage Your Site →](manage-site.md) guide to update content and handle submissions.
