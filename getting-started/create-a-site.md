# Create a Site

## Overview
Set up your Curvenote site to publish and share your work online

Creating a Curvenote site gives you a dedicated space to publish your research, lab work, or any scientific content. The process is simple and handled through our onboarding form.

## Before you start

- Curvenote account + CLI installed
- Only Curvenote staff can create sites — you'll use our onboarding form

## Request a site

- Fill out the [Site Setup Request Form](https://forms.gle/Y8ppqCpPFKPH5GFr7)
- Curvenote will set up:
  - **Title & subdomain** (e.g., `my-lab.curve.space`)
  - **Public or private** visibility
  - **Initial landing content**
- You'll receive a confirmation email once your site is live

## Next steps after creation

- Review your site's landing page
- Follow the [Site Management →](../sites/index.md) guide to update content and handle submissions
