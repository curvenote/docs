## Steps to Create a Site

Currently, site creation is only available via the web admin interface:  
1. Sign in to [curvenote.com](https://curvenote.com)  
2. Choose **Create Site**  
3. Set:
   - **Title** (e.g., “My Research Lab”)  
   - **Subdomain** (e.g., `my-lab.curve.space`)  
   - **Visibility** (public or private)  
   - **Owning Organization** or group  

_Coming Soon: CLI-based site creation._

### 2. Set the Landing Page
The landing page is the main entry point for visitors to your site:  
- Choose a featured article, collection, or custom page  
- Recommended: Set this in the web admin interface
