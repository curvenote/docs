# Publish & Share Your Article

## What you'll learn
How to publish your article and make it accessible online

Publishing your article with Curvenote is simple and fast. Whether you want to share your research publicly or submit it for review, Curvenote makes it easy to get your content live on the web.

## Before you publish

Make sure your project is ready:

- At least one article with content
- A valid `curvenote.yml` configuration file
- All required assets (figures, datasets, notebooks) included

If you're not sure your site is configured, see [Set Up a Site](create-a-site.md)

## Choose how to publish

**Publish directly to the web (public)**

This puts your project live on the `.curve.space` domain you set in `site.domains`:

```bash
curvenote deploy
```

**Submit to a site (for review or staged publishing)**

Send your project to a site (e.g., a lab site or journal). Only site admins can make it public:

```bash
curvenote submit <site>
```

If you have admin rights and want to publish from the CLI:

```bash
curvenote submission publish <site>
```

## See the result

- **Deploy:** The CLI will show your live `.curve.space` URL
- **Submit:** Your submission appears in the site's admin area. If published, the site will provide the public URL

## Update your content

- **If you deployed:** Run `curvenote deploy` again to replace the live version
- **If you submitted:** Run `curvenote submit <site>` to create a new submission version, then publish (via admin UI or `curvenote submission publish <site>`)

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Published content is "living" in Curvenote â€” you can make edits anytime, and your audience will always see the latest version.
