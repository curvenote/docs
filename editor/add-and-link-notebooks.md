Notebooks can be created in Jupyter then uploaded to a Curvenote project via the web app. You should always add pre-executed, saved notebooks to Curvenote so that outputs appear and are available for use. Notebooks that already exist on Curvenote can also be imported and linked to a local `.ipynb` file.

## Upload a Notebook - Curvenote

You can upload a Jupyter notebook to a Curvenote **project**. To upload an existing notebook:

- In the project navigation panel
  - Click the **Upload ☁️⬆️** icon
- Click to browse or drag and drop an `.ipynb` file from your computer
  - Click **DONE**

```{danger}
The upload process for notebooks on Curvenote should only be used if you do not intend to run the notebook! The local copy of your notebook will not be linked to Curvenote (it does not contain the necessary metadata for versioning). If you need to run this notebook you will have to manually link your local copy. Learn more [Add & Link Notebooks](oxa:m59m7JQmWVyPjlASj9v3/SiW5BdJkvLNs1kVQxnx0 "Add & Link Notebooks").
