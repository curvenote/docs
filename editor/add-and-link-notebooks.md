# Add & Link Notebooks

## Overview
Upload Jupyter notebooks to your Curvenote project and link them to local files for version control and collaboration

Notebooks can be created in Jupyter then uploaded to a Curvenote project via the web app. You should always add pre-executed, saved notebooks to Curvenote so that outputs appear and are available for use. Notebooks that already exist on Curvenote can also be imported and linked to a local `.ipynb` file.

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:
- A Curvenote project open
- A Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb` file) ready to upload
- The notebook is saved with executed outputs (if you want to display results)

## 1. Upload a Notebook to Curvenote

To upload an existing Jupyter notebook to your project:

1. **Open your project** in the Curvenote web app
2. **In the project navigation panel:**
   - Click the **Upload ‚òÅÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è** icon
3. **Add your notebook:**
   - Click to browse and select your `.ipynb` file
   - Or drag and drop the file from your computer
4. **Click "DONE"** to complete the upload

## 2. Link Local Notebooks (Recommended)

For notebooks you plan to continue working on, it's better to link your local copy:

1. **Upload the notebook** to Curvenote first (following steps above)
2. **In your local project folder:**
   - Place your `.ipynb` file in the appropriate directory
   - The file should be in the same location relative to your project structure
3. **Curvenote will automatically detect** the local file and link it
4. **Future changes** to your local notebook will sync with Curvenote

## 3. Use Notebooks in Your Articles

Once uploaded, you can:

- **Display notebook outputs** as figures in your articles
- **Reference specific cells** from your notebooks
- **Create interactive elements** that readers can explore
- **Version control** your notebooks alongside your articles


‚ö° **Important:
Upload vs. Link Workflow**

- **Upload only**: Use this if you don't plan to run the notebook again
- **Link local file**: Use this if you need to continue working on the notebook

The upload process does not create a link to your local file, so you'll need to manually link it if you want to continue editing.

üí° **Tip:** Always save your notebooks with executed outputs before uploading to Curvenote. This ensures that figures, charts, and other results are visible in your articles.
