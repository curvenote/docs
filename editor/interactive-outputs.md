title: Interactive Outputs
---

Curvenote is built to work hand in hand with Jupyter and allows you to directly use outputs from Jupyter as figures within your Curvenote articles. The versioning in Curvenote also allows for you to easily update your image in the article, rather than having to copy-and-paste a new static image each time you update your code. Curvenote also supports interactive Jupyter outputs, learn more [Interactive Outputs](./interactive-outputs-in-jupyter.md).

See [Jupyter](./jupyter-overview.md) documentation for more!

### Outputs as Figures

Once youâ€™ve imported your output cell into a Curvenote article, you can format the output as a figure. You can adjust the size and location, add a caption and numbering, and referencing the figure throughout your text. The formatting options are available in a toolbar that appears above or below the figure when you select the figure. Learn more about referencing figures [Internal References](./internal-references.md).
