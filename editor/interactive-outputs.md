# Add Interactive Outputs

## Quick Start
Use Jupyter notebook outputs as interactive figures in your Curvenote articles with automatic versioning and updates

Curvenote is built to work hand in hand with Jupyter and allows you to directly use outputs from Jupyter as figures within your Curvenote articles. The versioning in Curvenote also allows for you to easily update your image in the article, rather than having to copy-and-paste a new static image each time you update your code.

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:
- A Jupyter notebook with outputs you want to use
- The notebook linked to your Curvenote project
- An article where you want to add the interactive outputs

## Video Demo ðŸ“º

## 1. Import Jupyter Outputs

To use Jupyter outputs in your Curvenote articles:

1. **Open your Jupyter notebook** in Curvenote
2. **Select the output cell** you want to use (chart, plot, visualization, etc.)
3. **Copy the output** using the copy button or keyboard shortcut
4. **Paste into your article** where you want the output to appear

The output will appear as a figure in your article and maintain its connection to the original notebook.

## 2. Format Outputs as Figures

Once imported, you can format Jupyter outputs as interactive figures:

1. **Select the output** in your article
2. **Use the formatting toolbar** that appears:
   - Adjust size and location
   - Add captions and numbering
   - Set alignment and width
3. **The output becomes a figure** that can be referenced throughout your text

## 3. Reference Interactive Figures

You can reference interactive figures the same way as regular figures:

### Method 1: Command Menu
- Type `/link to figure` in your text
- Select the interactive figure from the dropdown menu

### Method 2: Keyboard Shortcut
- Type `[[fig:` in your text
- Select the interactive figure from the dropdown menu

## 4. Update Interactive Outputs

When you update your Jupyter notebook:

1. **Save your notebook** with the new outputs
2. **The linked outputs in your article** will automatically update
3. **No manual copying/pasting** required - Curvenote handles the versioning

This ensures your articles always show the latest results from your analysis.

## 5. Use Interactive Features

Interactive Jupyter outputs can include:

- **Interactive plots** (Plotly, Bokeh, etc.)
- **Dynamic visualizations** that respond to user input
- **Embedded widgets** and controls
- **Live data displays** that update automatically

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Interactive outputs maintain their full functionality when embedded in Curvenote articles, allowing readers to explore your data and visualizations directly within the document.
