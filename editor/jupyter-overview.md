# Notebooks

Notebooks are code-based documents, with the file extension _.ipynb_, that can be used with both Curvenote and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). Notebooks are separated into distinct cells of content, that can include code, outputs, and Markdown text. Similar to articles, notebooks live in [Projects](./curvenote-projects.md) on Curvenote and are made up of blocks (cells in Jupyter), but notebooks follow their own set of rules. By using Curvenote for Jupyter, you can collaborate around, version, share, and reuse your notebook content! Curvenote allows you to upload pre-executed notebooks into the web application.

```{important}
Notebooks can only be executed in your Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook working environment. Curvenote helps you share and publish, collaborate on, and share your notebooks and integrate them into your reports and books.
