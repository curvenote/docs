## Organizing Project Content

You can control the order of your project content. To do this:

- Access your project
- In the blue **navigation panel** to the left of your screen select, drag, and drop your article or notebook where you want it
- Content can be ordered and or nested by dragging it up and down or left to right

## Navigating Project Content

Your project navigation panel view will vary depending on the project visibility settings and your status as a collaborator or public viewer. Content with a lock üîí next to it is not displayed to the public in the navigation panel.

## Quickly Create an Article

When you hover over a navigation item, a shortcut is shown to create a new article directly underneath an existing navigation item or edit the settings of that document. If the item is a group, then you will be able to edit the group title or delete the group through the edit modal.
