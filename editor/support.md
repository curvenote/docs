If you are experiencing difficulties, Curvenote support can help. The best way to get support is to email us or reach out to the [Curvenote Slack](http://slack.curvenote.dev) team.

In order to support you directly, we may ask for temporary access to your project. This will allow us to reproduce issues firsthand, make changes for you, and/or test any fixes we deploy.

```{important}
While support has access to your project, all information and data will be treated as confidential. You remain in control of supportâ€™s access, and can remove support from your list of collaborators at any time.

```

## Curvenote Slack

Curvenote has a Community Slack Team which is a great place to get help, support, find other Curvenote users and stay up to date with the latest release information and give input on what is getting developed.

[**Join the Curvenote Community Slack Team**](http://slack.curvenote.dev)

The Curvenote founders and team are online daily across EU and North American time-zones, feel free to reach out to `@rowan` or `@steve` directly or post in `#help` or `#bugs`.

## Giving Curvenote Support access to your project

You can give support access to your project by adding the support user as a collaborator, like so:

:name: aiZ5vurJ22

Access your list of collaborators from the project settings dialog, add `support` from the list there.
```

Once added, support will be notified and you can also point us to particular places in your project by mentioning `@support` in a comment.
