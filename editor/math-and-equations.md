Curvenote supports and automatically renders $\LaTeX$ math symbols in either inline math or distinct equations. When equations are created, they can also be numbered and referenced within the text.

## Inline Math

You can create math equations inline with the rest of your text in Curvenote such as: $\int_{a}^{b} x^2 \,dx$. Inline math can be created using

- [Editing Toolbar](./editing-toolbar.md) â†’ âž• Insert Menu â†’ $\bf{\Sigma}$ **Inline Math**
- [Command Menu](./command-menu.md) `/` â†’ **Inline Math**
- Keyboard shortcut `$ $`

```

```{note}
We try our best to not trigger the inline math when you mean $1.00 and $2.00, however, if the math rule gets triggered - just press the backspace key or undo (`Ctrl/Cmd-z`) to undo the math creation.

```

## Equations

You can also create stand-alone equations that can be numbered and referenced throughout your text:

```{math}
:label: 05593f04

x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}
```

Equations can be created using

- Editing Toolbar â†’ âž• Insert Menu â†’ $\bf{\Sigma}$ **Equation Block**
- Command Menu `/` â†’ **Equation**
- Keyboard shortcut `$$`

Equations can be referenced by their numbers within the text using either the command menu or keyboard shortcuts. To reference an equation use one of the following two commands:

`/link to equation` `[[eq:`

Then select the equation you want to reference from the drop down menu. When you click on the reference a preview of the equation is displayed.

```{note}
The numbering is ordered by location of the equation on the page. All numbering will start at 1 at the beginning of the page. The numbering will automatically update with added or removed equations.
