description: Using collections in Curvenote venues
---

{term}`Collections <collection>` in Curvenote provide a flexible and structured way to organize and display published content within a {term}`Site`. They allow content to be grouped under various themes or types, making it easy for readers to discover relevant articles, papers, or other publication units. Collections are an essential part of creating a cohesive experience for audiences, helping to showcase curated groups of work that align with the goals and focus of your {term}`Site`.

Each Collection can include articles of one or more {term}`Submission Kind` allowing you to group different types of articles together, whether they are long-form research papers, blogs, video abstracts, or micropubs. Collections can be tailored to reflect categories relevant to your community or publication needs, such as topics, research areas, or article types. This structure also makes it easier for editorial teams to manage diverse types of content in a streamlined and organized manner.

Collections are displayed through listing pages on the landing site, using [dynamic listings](#dynamic-listings) that are automatically updated as new articles are added to the Collection, ensuring that your venueâ€™s content is always current as new articles are published. Dynamic listings are created by placing custom [directives](../directives.md) in the pages of your landing site, within your own content as appropriate.
