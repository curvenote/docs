# What is Curvenote?

Curvenote is a platform for writing, organizing, and publishing scientific content—built by researchers, for researchers.

It helps you move beyond static PDFs by enabling interactive, modular, and versioned scientific outputs. Whether you're drafting a preprint, creating a lab website, or sharing reproducible analyses, Curvenote provides the tools to publish with structure, transparency, and flexibility.

## A new kind of scientific output

Most research outputs today are frozen in time—locked into PDFs and detached from the data, code, or figures that created them. Curvenote enables a different approach:

- Modular articles with reusable blocks and components
- Versioned content that captures draft history and changes
- Web-first publishing that prioritizes discoverability
- Integrated exports to Typst and PDF when needed

## Write once, publish anywhere

Curvenote works in your browser or with the Curvenote CLI. You can:

- Write in Markdown, Jupyter, or the Curvenote editor
- Organize content into folders, articles, and blocks
- Connect to GitHub for version control and collaboration
- Publish to the web with a single command
- Export to Typst or PDF for review or submission

## Publishing is part of your workflow

Publishing with Curvenote is fast and flexible. You can publish:

- Single articles
- Multi-article collections (like lab sites or documentation)
- Research outputs with interactive figures, notebooks, and citations

Everything you publish remains editable and updateable—no reformatting required.

## Built for research teams

Curvenote supports:

- Collaborative editing and version tracking
- Reusable figures, text blocks, and citations
- DOI minting and metadata support
- Automated research integrity checks (iThenticate, Proofig)
- Compliance with open science, funder, and institutional policies

## Why it matters

Scientific knowledge should be open, versioned, and reusable. Curvenote is designed to support modern scientific communication by providing infrastructure for living research outputs.

Whether you're preparing a funder report, publishing a preprint, or launching a public-facing project, Curvenote helps you move faster, stay organized, and share your work in ways that are meaningful to both humans and machines.
