# Track Versions and Drafts

## Quick Start
Manage version history, track changes, and work with drafts across your Curvenote articles, notebooks, and blocks

Curvenote provides comprehensive version control for all your content. Every article, notebook, and block can be versioned independently, allowing you to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate safely with automatic draft saving and conflict resolution.

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:
- A Curvenote project with content to version
- Access to the Curvenote editor interface
- Understanding of draft mode vs. saved versions
- Content you want to track changes for

## 1. Understand Version Control

**Drafts vs. Versions**: Drafts are temporary working copies, versions are permanent saved states

**Auto-save**: All changes saved locally as you work

**Individual versioning**: Articles, notebooks, and blocks versioned separately

**Collaboration**: Multiple people can work simultaneously with conflict resolution

## 2. Work with Drafts

**Enter Draft Mode**: Click **EDIT** ‚Üí Yellow ‚úèÔ∏è indicator appears

**Auto-save**: Changes saved automatically as you type

**Status bar**: Green=synced, orange=10+ unsaved changes, red=not synced

**Exit Draft Mode**: **STOP EDITING** (keeps draft) or **SAVE VERSION** (creates new version)

## 3. Save New Versions

**Save article version**: Click **SAVE VERSION** in app bar ‚Üí Redirected to new version

**Save block version**: Select block ‚Üí Block Details Panel ‚Üí **SAVE VERSION**

**Save notebook version**: Click **SAVE VERSION** ‚Üí Saves all draft blocks/cells

**Version numbering**: Automatically increments (v1, v2, v3, etc.)

## 4. View Version History

**View article versions**: Exit Draft Mode ‚Üí Block Details Panel ‚Üí Browse version list

**View block versions**: Select block ‚Üí Block Details Panel ‚Üí Click version numbers

**Version information**: Shows date, time, and version number

**Preview versions**: Click version to preview in place of current version

## 5. Switch Between Versions

**Preview first**: Click version number to preview without switching

**Use version**: Click **USE VERSION** button or version ‚ãÆ Options ‚Üí Use Version

**Clear preview**: Click **CLEAR PREVIEW** to return to current version

**Use latest**: Click **USE LATEST** to return to most recent version

## 6. Handle Collaboration Conflicts

**Stale draft warning**: Appears when someone else saves a version while you're editing

**Warning indicators**: Yellow ‚úèÔ∏è turns red, warning message at top

**Discard stale draft**: Click √ó icon ‚Üí **DELETE** ‚Üí Page reloads automatically

**Re-enter draft mode**: Click **EDIT** to continue working on latest version

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Unsaved changes are lost when discarding stale drafts

## 7. Export from Versions

**Exit draft mode**: Must be in View Mode to export

**Save draft changes**: Click **SAVE VERSION** to include recent changes

**Export saved version**: Click **STOP EDITING** to export without draft changes

**Export formats**: PDF, Word, LaTeX, Markdown from saved versions only
