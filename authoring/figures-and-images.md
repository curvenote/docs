# Add Figures, Images, and Media

## Overview
Add images, GIFs, and other media to your Curvenote articles using drag-and-drop or copy-paste methods

Curvenote supports various image formats (JPEG, TIFF, PNG, etc.) and GIFs that can be added to content blocks or displayed as standalone figures. Once added, images can be formatted, resized, and given numbered captions for easy referencing throughout your document.

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:
- A Curvenote project with content you want to add images to
- Images or GIFs ready to upload from your computer
- Access to the Curvenote editor interface
- Images in supported formats (JPEG, TIFF, PNG, GIF)

2. **Double-click** within the content block or select it and press `enter`

### Add Your Image
Choose one of these methods:

**Drag and Drop:**
- **Drag images** from your computer directly into the content block
- **A line appears** as you drag, showing where the image will be placed
- **Drop the image** and it appears below that line

**Copy and Paste:**
- **Copy an image** from your clipboard
- **Paste it** directly into the content block

**Command Menu:**
