When you export an article from Curvenote, you can choose to use any of our professional templates. Templates may require special components exist within your manuscript such as an abstract, summary or acknowledgements. Curvenote uses tags to indicate what within your article is considered to be these special components. When you initiate an export of your article, Curvenote will check that the required tags exist for that particular template.
