Curvenote integrates directly with Jupyter through the Curvenote Jupyter Extension - [Jupyter Versioning & Comments](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jupyter-versioning-commen/egkbkefajoeehbmjgelpmdnpgnleknka) for Chrome, Brave, or Microsoft Edge. Curvenote for Jupyter provides version control and direct collaboration within your notebooks. With the direct link between Curvenoteâ€™s writing platform and the Jupyter environment, you can integrate, share, and reuse your code and visualization throughout your writing projects. Curvenote maintains a live link between multiple instances your Jupyter notebook cells, meaning you can update your code in Jupyter and automatically see those changes in your Curvenote article.

# Notebooks

Notebooks are code-based documents, with the file extension *.ipynb*, that can be used with both Curvenote and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). Notebooks are separated into distinct cells of content, that can include code, outputs, and Markdown text. Similar to articles, notebooks live in [Projects](oxa:MshxlXndaLsk3WbJ0ZGy/RjYgi06EXDbVMPcbOLxL "Projects") on Curvenote and are made up of blocks (cells in Jupyter), but notebooks follow their own set of rules. By using Curvenote for Jupyter, you can collaborate, version, share, and reuse your notebook content! Curvenote offers two methods to interact with your notebooks - the [Curvenote Jupyter Extension](oxa:MshxlXndaLsk3WbJ0ZGy/xnBy2RBPDIocOLmHxNOB "Curvenote Jupyter Extension") and the Curvenote web app.

````{important}
At this time, Notebooks can only be executed in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook. Curvenote helps you share and publish, collaborate on, and share your notebooks and integrate them into your reports and books.
