Curvenote does not currently run your code outside of Jupyter, but you can share executable versions of your notebooks on Curvenote using Binder. [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) is a public service that allows you to share a repository of notebooks within their executable environment for anyone with access to run and reproduce your results. On Curvenote, you can add a Binder link to your notebooks and add notebooks from Binder to your own Curvenote projects.

## Launch Binder Button

You can add a launch Binder button to notebooks on Curvenote that you want others to run through Binder. To add a Binder link:

- Open your notebook on Curvenote.
- Click **EDIT** to enter Draft Mode.
- Open the $\mathbf{\vdots}$ **Page Options** menu.
  - Select **Settings**.
- Paste your Binder link into the Binder URL field.
- Click **UPDATE SETTINGS**.
- The launch binder button will appear to the left of the author and date section at the top of your notebook.

## Add Notebook from Binder

Typically, any changes that you make to a notebook running through Binder are lost when you leave. Using the Curvenote Jupyter Extension you can add a notebook running on Binder to your own Curvenote projects and version your work within it. To add a notebook on Binder to Curvenote:

- Launch the Binder link with Google Chrome.
- Click the **SAVE TO PROJECT** button in the Jupyter toolbar.
  - This will open the Curvenote extension panel.
- In the **Save this Notebook** section, select a Curvenote project.
  - Click the üîΩ to expand the list of projects.
  - Select a project.
  - Click **SAVE NOTEBOOK.**
    - This process may take a some time.
    - This will only save and version changes to the notebook while the current link is open. If you leave the page after this step, your previous versions will {u}`not` be available.
- In the Jupyter toolbar, click the **save to browser storage ‚òÅÔ∏è ‚¨áÔ∏è** button.

````{danger}
When you next launch the Binder link for the notebook you have previously added to Curvenote, you will need to click the **restore from browser storage ‚òÅÔ∏è ‚¨ÜÔ∏è** button in the Jupyter toolbar to access previous versions and changes on Curvenote.
