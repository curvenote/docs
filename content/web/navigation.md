# Actions

Actions are buttons that appear on the right of the navigation bar. By default, a single ‚ÄúLearn More‚Äù action is added to new curvenote sites. You can add, customize and remove actions by editing the `actions:` list in the `site:` section of the root `curvenote.yml` file.

```yaml
version: 1
site:
  actions:
    - title: Learn More
      url: https://docs.curvenote.com/web
```

‚öíÔ∏è To Customize the existing action, simply update the `title:` and `url:` fields in place

```yaml
version: 1
site:
  actions:
    - title: Curvenote on GitHub
      url: https://gihub.com/curvenote
```

‚öíÔ∏è To add more actions, add additional items to the YAML list, each with their own `title:` and `url:` fields

```yaml
version: 1
site:
  actions:
    - title: GitHub
      url: https://gihub.com/curvenote
    - title: Sign Up
      url: https://curvenote.com/signup
```

üõ†Ô∏è To remove all actions, set the field to an empty list `actions: []`

```yaml
version: 1
site:
  actions: []
```

# Including Static Files

You can include static files like PDF documents in the `public` folder in the root of your site; these will be deployed with the rest of your site. To include these in the action, put a `static: true`, which will ensure the PDF opens in a new tab and the URL is modified correctly. The `url` should point to your public folder.

```yaml
site:
  actions:
    - title: Download Thesis
      url: public/my_thesis.pdf
      static: true
```

For auto-generated PDF files from your content, you can build these with Curvenote.
