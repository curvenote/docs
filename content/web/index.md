Curvenote allows you to easily publish content on the web as a fast, optimized site that preserves all interactive features in Curvenote, deployed on our hosting service called [curve.space](https://curve.space) and can also be hosted on your own [custom domain](oxa:Eh6WvY9NT46Ds4lE3OqJ/Qn9rzCukuPlbwhKl8qA0 "Custom Domains").

**There are two ways to get started:**

- [Start with a Curvenote project](oxa:Eh6WvY9NT46Ds4lE3OqJ/cMzSX755ZfawTQbU41BV "Start with a Curvenote project") - you have content in Curvenote
- [Start with a local folder](oxa:Eh6WvY9NT46Ds4lE3OqJ/awl1FKZAY7CpiX7GWWXS "Start with a local folder") - you have existing content in a local folder or `git` repository

## Example Websites using Curvenote

Curvenote is being used to create all sorts of content:

- Blogs & technical websites
- Papers & reports
- Seminar & conference websites
- Courses & books
- Sharing Jupyter Notebooks

**Note**

Creating and deploying a website currently requires you to use the Curvenote Command Line Interface. You can see documentation about installing and getting started in our [CLI docs](https://curvenote.com/oxa:EplL6AlILV3RGEDPzj5U/qO37OgRXvWSbykWGvaDR).

In the future you will be able to create and update websites directly from the Curvenote application online.
