## Setting the Homepage

When your site is initialized, the CLI will look for a file to use as the ‚Äúroot‚Äù of the site, which will be the page displayed when someone browses to `https://username.curve.space`. The CLI will choose the root file in the following order:

1. `index.md`
2. `README.md`
3. The first `.md` file found alphabetically
4. `index.ipynb`
5. `README.ipynb`
6. The first `.ipynb` file found alphabetically

Filenames are not treated as case sensitive.
