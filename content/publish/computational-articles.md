We have identified two main patterns that take advantage of Curvenote's computational capabilities: **Computational Articles** and **Computational Reports**.

Computational Articles
: Structured around a core manuscript with attached supporting materials, **computational articles** focus on providing **in-context interactive figures** and notebooks with a strong narrative flow. Interactive figures can be executed independently, and notebooks are integrated into the main content. A separate JupyterLab environment can be launched by the reader, allowing them to explore the content fully and encourage re-use and further experimentation.
: Examples: [pyUserCalc](https://agu.curve.space/articles/NN0002)

Computational Reports & Tutorials
: Computational reports include the same interactive features as articles, they are structured more like a "book"â€”presenting a collection of notebooks within a broader narrative. These reports emphasize comprehensive documentation and exploration of the computational environment. Readers can launch a **JupyterLab instance** to interact with the notebooks or, optionally, execute the notebooks in place within the report.
: Example: [Tilt-Corrected BF-STEM](https://www.elementalmicroscopy.com/articles/EM000002)

In both cases, it's important to carefully consider the **computational environment** for your article or report. Whether you're working in Python, Julia, or R, best practices for **dependency management** and **reproducibility** are essential.
