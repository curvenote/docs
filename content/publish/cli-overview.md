`curvenote` is a command line interface (CLI) that provides modern tooling for technical writing, reproducible science, and creating scientific & technical websites. To get started install curvenote:

```shell
npm install -g curvenote
```

See [Installing Curvenote](./installing.md) for more details, you must have a node version greater than 14 (see [Installing NodeJS](./installing-prerequisites.md) for more information).

The CLI and all dependencies made by Curvenote are [open-source](https://github.com/curvenote/curvenote) (MIT License) and we contribute to upstream projects where we can (e.g. our founders are members of [Executable Books](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/team.html)). The Curvenote CLI provides local content transformations, with an early focus on providing 100s of [LaTeX templates](https://github.com/curvenote/templates) for various scientific journals. The library also provides a connection to sync your local documents with Curvenote to aid in collaborative writing, especially in bridging the gap between those who can use Markdown, Git, and a Shell and those of us who are not programmers. We think this is especially important for writing workflows, where the collaboration and communication process is often quite different than a Git-driven approach.
