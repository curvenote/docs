:::{glossary}

Work
: A _"work"_ refers to the original content created and owned by an author, encompassing articles and {term}`notebook`s, or other scholarly outputs (i.e. the research {term}`compendium`). Works are owned by the author and can be submitted to multiple {term}`venue`s, allowing for broader dissemination and engagement within the academic or professional community.

Work Version
: A _"work version"_ is a specific instance of a {term}`work` that encapsulates changes or updates made by the author over time. Each version maintains a record of its evolution, reflecting revisions, additions, or corrections.

Submission Version
: A _"submission version"_ is a particular iteration of a {term}`work` that is submitted to a {term}`venue`. This version is tracked to document the progression and evaluation of the submission through the editorial and review processes at the venue.

Venue
: A _"venue"_ may refer to a journal, conference website, research group, blog or private site hosted on the Curvenote platform. A venue is organized into {term}`collections <collection>` which can take {term}`submissions <submission>`.

Submission Kind
: A {term}`venue` can accept submission _"kinds"_. For example, _Abstract_, _Research Article_, _Letter_, _Poster_ or conceivably anything automated {term}`checks` that are run on each submission kind.

Checks
: Checks are specific to the {term}`submission kind` and can include checks on structure, integrity, manuscript content, plagiarism, image-manipulation, etc.

Notebook
: A _"notebook"_ refers to an interactive document used for coding, data analysis, visualization, and narrative text. Commonly associated with Jupyter Notebooks or Markdown notebooks, these documents combine executable code blocks with rich text elements, such as equations, images, and annotations, allowing for dynamic and interactive educational or research presentations.

Compendium
: A research _compendium_ is a set of articles, {term}`notebooks <notebook>`, associated data and computational environment that is organized and presented in a comprehensive and accessible manner.

Submission
: A _"submission"_ refers to the article or {term}`compendium` submitted to a {term}`venue` by an author or group of authors. Each submission is versioned to track changes and revisions over time. A submission can be submitted as a {term}`draft`.

Draft
: A _"draft"_ is a preliminary version of a {term}`submission` that can be uploaded to a {term}`venue` for testing purposes. Drafts allow authors to utilize the venue's build system to check their submissions, preview them on the venue's website, and, in the case of Computational Articles or Notebook-based Reports, ensure the computational environment configuration functions correctly on the venue's servers.
: Drafts are standalone and are not visible to the editorial team, are not formally received by the venue, and are automatically deleted after 30 days.

Collection
: A collection is a way to organize submissions in a {term}`venue` publications by year and that at least one currently open for submission.

Preview
: A _"preview"_ is displayable or viewable version of a {term}`submission` that is used primarily for peer review purposes. The preview can be public or private, depending on the editorial workflow, and allows reviewers and potentially other stakeholders to see how the submission will appear upon publication, facilitating a thorough evaluation of its content, formatting, and overall presentation. The preview helps to ensure that the submission meets the required standards and guidelines of the {term}`venue` before final approval and publication.
