```{tip} Objective
The starting point for this guide will be a local MyST Project complete with content and frontmatter builds to a website without issues.
This could follow on from the [Writing a scientific paper in MyST](authoring-in-myst.md) guide.

By the end of the guide you should be able to use the Curvenote CLI to submit your work to a journal and submit updates to it in future.
