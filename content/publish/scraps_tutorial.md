:::{tip} Objective
In this guide you will learn about:

- How to meet (and check in advance) the requirements of the venue you are submitting to
- **Essential** additional steps for a Computational Articles or Notebook based Reports
- As well as tips for making the most of the frontmatter, metadata and styling that will be attached to your submission.

The starting point for this guide is a local MyST Project complete with content and frontmatter that builds to a website without issues.

If you are working on a real submission, this guide will take you through the process of preparing your submission.

If you are here to learn you can use any MyST project or use the [myst-quickstart](https://github.com/executablebooks/mystmd-quickstart).
:::

## Pre-requisites

If you have not already done so:

- [Install the Curvenote CLI](installing.md) and setup your [API Token](authentication.md)
- Prepare a local folder containing your MyST submission OR clone the [quickstart project](https://github.com/executablebooks/mystmd-quickstart)
- and `cd` into that folder

## Getting Started

The first step in preparing your submission is to check your MyST project for errors and warnings on one hand and against the specific requirements of the Venue on the other.
