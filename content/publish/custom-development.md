Curvenote engages in custom development work to further the open-source components we develop. Examples of this are custom MyST Markdown themes, new Jupyter or MyST directives and components that can help communicate research by enabling specific visualizations, data integration or interactivity in a particular field.

## Examples

Some examples of previous development work include:

- Custom themes, banners, headers and footers (e.g. [Lab Groups at Stanford](https://colab.stanford.edu/), [Landing Themes](https://qiime2.org))
- Custom components and directives (e.g. [Discourse Forum Component](https://qiime2.org/))
- Improved LaTeX reading and rendering (e.g. for [Econ-ARK](https://econ-ark.github.io/FOSSProF))
- JATS improvements for computational notebooks (e.g. for [AGU Notebooks Now](https://curvenote.github.io/notebooks-in-publishing/))

## Grant friendly

If you are writing a grant to enable something we are happy to contribute to making that happen. We can work with you as a partner on the grant, on a consultancy basis, or for a fixed price. If the features you are looking to develop are close to our existing roadmap, we would love the extra motivation and the chance to work closely with you to accommodate your use cases.
