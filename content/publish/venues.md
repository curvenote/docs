A {term}`venue` may refer to a journal, conference website, research group or private site hosted on the Curvenote platform.

Each Venue has it's own different rules on:

- Whether submissions are open to the public or closed and can only be made by invitation or by a publishing team
- Which {term}`submission kind` can be accepted. e.g. _Abstract_, _Research Article_, _Letter_ or conceivably anything
- automated checks that are run on each submission, specific to the Kind which can include checks on structure, integrity, manuscript content, plagiarism and so on
- Whether a Venue, or one of it's _"Collections"_, is currently open to submissions

If the venue is a scientific journal many accept the submissions of kind _Article_.

If you are working on a real submission, check the submission instructions from the venue for the correct _Venue Name_, _Collection_ and _Submission Kind_ to target. If you are just here to learn or practice, you can submit to the venue `cn-testing` using the default collection and kind.
