Using the Curvenote CLI to deploy your MyST website is the fastest and easiest way to get your content online. [curve.space](https://curve.space) is a free dedicated hosting service for MyST websites that is linked with your account on https://curvenote.com.

You can deploy multiple websites to curve.space to subdomains of your choice either at `https://username.curve.space` or `https://username-any_subdomain_suffix.curve.space` and your content will be made live immediately and served using fast, modern web hosting infrastructure backed by Vercel and Google Cloud.

Use `curve.space` to publish academic websites, project documentation or reports, preprints, or anything else that will fit into a MyST Website. Some examples of open technical content published on `curve.space` by our users are:

- [ClimaSoMa Report](https://climasoma.curve.space/) - a multi author report on EU funding
- [PhD thesis - Geophysical Inversion](https://https://phd.row1.ca/)
- [PrePrint - La Palma Eruption](https://stevejpurves-lapalma.curve.space/la-palma-earthquakes)

Start publishing your MyST Websites now, setup the [Curvenote CLI](./cli-overview.md) and [configure your project](hosting.md).

## Online Service

Curvenote provides a service called Launchpad, hosted at <https://try.curvenote.com>, that allows you to generate a website directly from a GitHub or GitLab repo.
