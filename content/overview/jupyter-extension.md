# Jupyter Extension

+++ {"oxa":"oxa:w6jXebeTS6WGaVFDIEz9/fqjECd4OmeXhmNdWiHZQ.1"}

Curvenote directly integrates with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), which is a computational notebook environment for data-scientists and researchers. By using the Curvenote Jupyter Extension - [Jupyter Versioning & Comments](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jupyter-versioning-commen/egkbkefajoeehbmjgelpmdnpgnleknka) for Chrome, Brave, or Microsoft Edge you can add, share, version, collaborate, and reuse your code and visualizations. By integrating directly with your computational environment, you can create Curvenote documents that are reproducible and remain interactive - no matter if you are taking meeting notes or writing a manuscript.

## Curvenote Jupyter Extension

With the Curvenote Jupyter Extension installed, any time you open a notebook with either Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook you will have access to the Curvenote features. The standard views of how Curvenote is integrated into Jupyter Lab and Notebook are shown below. Each type of cell (code, Markdown, and output) is individually versioned, and their changes tracked within the cells. Curvenote adds buttons to the Jupyter toolbar in either view that version the entire notebook. All other options and features are available when the Curvenote Jupyter Expansion panel is expanded on the right of the screen.
