`curvenote` is a library and a command line interface (CLI) that provides modern tooling for technical writing and reproducible science. Our [mission](https://curvenote.com/why) is to help in transitioning scientific communication out of static documents and promote more connections between how researchers work, and how they share that work.

Critical to that mission is providing tools that:

1. are accessible to programmers and non-programmers alike;
2. allow creation of interactive, computationally driven online documents;
3. allow you to reuse components of documents across various resources; and
4. export to traditional formats, like PDF, PPT and Word to support your existing workflows.

The CLI and all dependencies made by Curvenote are open-source (MIT License) and we contribute to upstream projects where we can (e.g. our founders are members of [Executable Books](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/team.html)). The Curvenote CLI provides local content transformations, with an early focus on providing 100s of [LaTeX templates](https://github.com/curvenote/templates) for various scientific journals. The library also provides a connection to sync your local documents with [curvenote.com](https://curvenote.com/) to aid in collaborative writing, especially in bridging the gap between those who can use Markdown, Git, and a Shell and those of us who are not programmers. We think this is especially important for writing workflows, where the collaboration and communication process is often quite different than a Git-driven approach.

**⭐ Roadmap ⭐**

We are releasing a version of `curvenote` on Jan 20, 2022 that is an early preview mostly focused on export of static documents (PDF and Word) from Curvenote. Our general roadmap over the coming months is:

1. support JupyterBook as a first class interoperable format;
2. provide additional LaTeX and Word templates that support multi-article content (e.g. thesis, large reports);
3. support two-way data-sync to Markdown and other supported formats; and
4. support new interactive formats for HTML publishing.
