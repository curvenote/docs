Tables can be added throughout your Curvenote content. After creating the standard $2\times 2$ table, you can format it by adding or removing rows, columns and headers. A variety of specialized content can be added within the cells of your table such as equations, lists, code blocks, images, links and more! Tables are easily converted to the necessary format when you export your content from Curvenote.
