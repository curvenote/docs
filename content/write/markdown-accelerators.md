# Markdown Accelerators

+++ {"oxa":"oxa:Z1isOjJQGvM22q5fhunb/ruTcSLq6bg7OeJWO0f9N.1"}

The Curvenote editor supports a variety of [basic Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) formatting commands. The formatting is displayed automatically as you create your content so you’ll always know what your viewers will see. Though Curvenote supports most basic Markdown commands, some such as adding images and hyperlinks are not supported.

## Markdown Accelerated Editing

The following Markdown command options are currently available within Curvenote. All of these are optional and can also be accessed using the [Command Menu](oxa:Z1isOjJQGvM22q5fhunb/gKX5CnZEMGcUbygsA0dh "Command Menu"), keyboard shortcuts, or the options menu where appropriate.

### Headings

Start a line with a number of `#`’s, for example, `###` creates a level-3 heading. You can create headings of different levels, any text on the line will be formatted as your selected heading. Headings are recognized by Curvenote and can be numbered and cross-referenced. Learn more ➡️ [Internal Referencing](oxa:MshxlXndaLsk3WbJ0ZGy/nFyicOUy014lE2zKFsga "Internal Referencing").

### Text Formatting

You can use the Markdown commands to create **bold**, *italic*, or {strike}`strikethrough` text.

* `**Bold**` `__Bold__`
* `*Italic*` `_Italic_`
* `~~Strikethrough~~`

You can also format text using the standard keyboard shortcuts (`⌘B`, `⌘I`) or the editing toolbar.

### Lists

You can add either a Bullet Point or Numbered List to your block. When you add a list, you can start from an empty line or place your cursor in front of text you have already added. Only that line of text will be added to your list. Once you’ve created a list, you can use `tab` to indent the list, and `shift` `tab` to outdent the list. Press `enter` when you need to exit a list.

* `-` or `*` or `+` at the start of a line, followed by a space
* `1.` or `5.` to start a numbered list at a specific number

### Block Quotes

You can add a quote block either at the start of an empty line or place your cursor in front of text you have already added.

* `>` followed by a space

### Inline Code and Code Blocks

You can format inline text as code or add a code block. Code in a block is syntax highlighted with a specified language.

* `` `code` `` creates inline code, you can also select a string of text and press `` ` ``
* ```` ``` ```` creates an code block, you can then specify the language

### Thematic Break

You can add a horizontal line to separate the content within your block.

* `---`
* `***`

### Math and Equations

You can surround math by `$` for inline math, and start a line with `$$` to create an equation block. See [Math & Equations](oxa:Z1isOjJQGvM22q5fhunb/Y0cAWcbYJy11ZBXmGSAm "Math & Equations") for more.

### Emojis

If you like to spice up your content with emojis, use the colon symbol. From here you’ll be able to select from a drop-down list of emojis, or keep typing to search for the emoji you want! 🚀

* `:` followed by the name of the emoji, type enter to select
