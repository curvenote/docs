# Articles

+++ {"oxa":"oxa:Z1isOjJQGvM22q5fhunb/XccodkmtHQh7VFPEzEyW.1"}

Articles are text-based documents within Curvenote that can be used for a variety of purposes. Articles live in [Projects](https://curvenote.com/oxa:w6jXebeTS6WGaVFDIEz9/9d32qzwBWH2BsgNBGwEP) and are separated into distinct sections of content called blocks, which can include images, videos, citations, equations, tables, interactive Jupyter outputs and more! Articles and their blocks can be versioned, reused, and edited simultaneously by your and your collaborators.

### Status Bar

Draft mode is also indicated in the status bar at the bottom of the page. When you and your collaborators make changes to your draft, the status bar will update as your changes are saved or syncing across Curvenote. In some instances, Curvenote may not be able to sync as quickly as you edit. When the status bar is orange, the last 10 changes you made to the document have not been synced. This usually fixes itself in a few seconds. If you continue to edit, the status bar may turn red and the content you have written has not been synced to Curvenote.

### Local Backups

All your changes are saved locally, and are available at the bottom of the versions tab. If you have edited content on disk, you can preview and restore your local backups. This action creates a new version of your block.
