Images and GIFs can be added into articles by dragging them into a content block, or using the editing menu. Once added, images can be resized, and have numbered captions, which allow you to reference the figures in other parts of your document.

## Add Image or GIF

Static image formats (JPEG, TIFF, PNG, etc.) and GIFs are all supported and treated the same throughout Curvenote. To add an image or GIF you can either drag and drop from your computer or copy paste from your clipboard. Images and GIFs must be added to an existing content block when they are first added to Curvenote. After they have been added, they can be copied out via their oxa link and pasted as their own block within an article or notebook.

To add an image/GIF to an existing content block:

- You must be in Draft Mode for the page and block.
  - To enter Draft Mode for the page click **EDIT** at the top of the page.
  - To enter Draft Mode for the block, double click within the block or select the block and hit `enter`.
- You can use any of the following to add one or multiple images/GIFs
  - **Drag and drop** images/GIFs from your computer directly into your block
    - A line will appear as you drag, and once you drop your images will appear below that line
  - **Paste** images/GIFs directly into your block
  - Open the **command menu** `/` and search for `image` then
    - Drag and drop your images/GIFs into the box
    - Click within the box to browse and select your files
  - Open the **insert menu** in the editing toolbar and select **Image** then
    - Drag and drop your images/GIFs into the box
    - Click within the box to browse and select your files
- The transparency may pulse while the images/GIFs uploads.

## Image and GIF Settings

Images and GIFs are a special type of blocks in Curvenote. As shown above they can be displayed on their own within an article or notebook. They also have their own settings and versioning. Both can be used as a Figure with numbering, captions, and internal referencing within your content.

### Versioning

No matter if your image/GIF is displayed as its own block or within another block, it is versioned independently. New versions are created when you replace the image or update the image caption. When the image/GIF is selected, you can access the previous versions and choose to use them as you would a block, in the Block Details Panel.

Replacing an image/GIF will create a new version of the image/GIF block. To replace a block (not delete it):

- Select the image/GIF you want to replace.
- Drag and drop or paste a new image onto the previous.

To use a different version of an image/GIF:

- Select the image/GIF.
- Expand the **Block Details Panel** on the right of the page.
- Select a version you want to use.
  - A preview of that version will appear in place of the current image/GIF.
- Click **USE VERSION**.

### Settings

You can access and update the image/GIF block settings when the it is displayed either in a content block or on its own. The settings for an image/GIF block include the URL, title, description, image caption, and tags.

### Figures

Image and GIFs can be formatted as Figures within your content on Curvenote. This means that they can be numbered, have captions displayed, and referenced throughout your text.

To toggle the caption and or numbering for an image/GIF:

- Select the image.
- In the formatting toolbar that appears:
  - Select the lines symbol for the **Show/Hide Caption** option.
  - When the caption is shown, you can then enable numbering by selecting the number icon for the **Toggle Numbering** option.

````{note}
For figures displayed within a content block, when the caption is toggled on, the caption can be edited directly by clicking the **EDIT** button on the image.

Figures can be referenced by their numbers within the text using either the command menu or keyboard shortcuts.
