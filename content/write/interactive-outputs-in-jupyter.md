Most interactive output cells from Jupyter will remain interactive when viewed on Curvenote! Plots and displays created using libraries and packages such as [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/), [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/), [Bokeh-Holoviews](https://holoviews.org/index.html), [Bokeh-Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/index.html), [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html#), [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), [Seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) maintain a local state and therefore you can continue to interact with them outside of Jupyter. Curvenote cannot currently run code cells, thus features such as [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) are not interactive on Curvenote. A few examples are shown below and you can see more ➡️ [Example Notebooks](https://curvenote.com/@curvenote/example-notebooks)
