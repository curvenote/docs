When you export an article from Curvenote, you can choose to use any of our professional templates. Templates may require special components exist within your manuscript such as an abstract, summary or acknowledgements. Curvenote uses tags to indicate what within your article is considered to be these special components. When you initiate an export of your article, Curvenote will check that the required tags exist for that particular template.

## Template Options

After selecting a template, you will proceed to the Template Options page(s). The first page of Export - Template Options includes information that is needed in addition to the manuscript. Learn more [Template Options](./export-template-options.md).

These components need to be tagged within the article for your to proceed to export.

The number of **Required** and **Optional** content options varies depending on the template you select and is shown in the upper right corner of the window. Read through the option fields carefully and include the appropriate information.
