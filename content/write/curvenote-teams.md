You can create teams with other Curvenote users, so you can easily collaborate on your projects and content. Teams are similar to a personal profile, in that they have their own public profiles and can own projects.

## Modifying Your Team Profile

You can modify team profiles the same way you modify your personal profile, such as adding banner and profile images, a team description, and other affiliations.

### Profile Image

Profile images will be shown as a badge on your personal profile image, when you‚Äôre working in that team space. To upload a profile image:

- Navigate to the **SETTINGS** tab
- In the profile image area, drag and drop the image you‚Äôd like or follow the prompts to upload a new image
- (Optional) adjust the image to your preference

## Navigating Teams

If you want to view the Curvenote page for any of the teams you‚Äôve joined:

- Click your **Profile Image** in the app bar
- Select the team page you‚Äôd like to view

You will be taken to the team page. A badge (which will be the public profile image of that team) will also be added to your profile image in the top banner. This allows you to easily check what team space you‚Äôre working in.

## What else can you do with Teams?

Once you‚Äôve invited your team members and have set up your public profile, there‚Äôs many more things you can do! Similar to your personal profile, you can create [Projects](oxa:w6jXebeTS6WGaVFDIEz9/9d32qzwBWH2BsgNBGwEP "Projects") within a team, and within those projects you can create and collaborate on content.
