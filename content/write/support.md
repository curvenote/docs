If you are experiencing difficulties, Curvenote support can help. The best way to get support is to email us or reach out to the [Curvenote Slack](http://slack.curvenote.dev) team.

In order to support you directly, we may ask for temporary access to your project. This will allow us to reproduce issues firsthand, make changes for you, and/or test any fixes we deploy.

````{important}
While support has access to your project, all information and data will be treated as confidential. You remain in control of supportâ€™s access, and can remove support from your list of collaborators at any time.

````

## Curvenote Slack

Curvenote has a Community Slack Team which is a great place to get help, support, find other Curvenote users and stay up to date with the latest release information and give input on what is getting developed.

## Giving Curvenote Support access to your project

You can give support access to your project by adding the support user as a collaborator, like so:

```{figure} images/w6jXebeTS6WGaVFDIEz9-dB0zGvlqHeHHKr9tQ94G-v1.gif
:name: aiZ5vurJ22
:align: center
:width: 70%

Access your list of collaborators from the project settings dialog, add `support` from the list there.
```

Once added, support will be notified and you can also point us to particular places in your project by mentioning `@support` in a comment.
