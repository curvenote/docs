title: Overview of Curvenote Publishing
short_title: Curvenote Sites
---

Curvenote is a platform for scientific writing and publishing, in this documentation we will go through writing, publishing, and administering a site as well as provide various tutorials. Curvenote is designed to streamline the process of collaboration, creation, and dissemination of scientific knowledge, integrating seamlessly with computational notebooks, and interactive data visualizations with live computation. Whether you're drafting your next paper, highlighting the work of your lab group, hosting a conference, or managing a journal, Curvenote provides the tools and flexibility you need to communicate modern science.

Curvenote allows you to easily publish scientific content on the web as a fast, optimized website either deployed on our [free hosting service](oxa:Eh6WvY9NT46Ds4lE3OqJ/6xTpl07Az7VN9tdldJAt 'Hosting on curve.space') or your own [custom domains](./sites/custom-domains.md).

**You can publish directly from Curvenote or a git repository:**

- [Hosting your Website](oxa:Eh6WvY9NT46Ds4lE3OqJ/6xTpl07Az7VN9tdldJAt 'Hosting your Website') - Publish any Curvenote project in a single click
- Use [Curvenote Launchpad](https://try.curvenote.com) if you have your content in a public GitHub/GitLab repository

**Or use Command Line Interface:**

- [Start with a Curvenote project](oxa:Eh6WvY9NT46Ds4lE3OqJ/cMzSX755ZfawTQbU41BV 'Start with a Curvenote project') - you have content in Curvenote and can `clone` it locally
- [Start with a local folder](oxa:Eh6WvY9NT46Ds4lE3OqJ/awl1FKZAY7CpiX7GWWXS 'Start with a local folder') - you have existing content in a local folder or `git` repository
